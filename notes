// index.js will have to hold information for inquirer
// index.js will take that information based on selections will generate shapes based on the users inputs and pass the inputs to the generateshapes.js and shapes.test.js which are located in the lib folder
// generateshapes.js will build a svg file using a html style that is embedded in the code 
// The code for the generateshapes.js will have to render shapes using circles rectangles triangles and text
// The code for the generateshapes.js will also handle the colors by "name input" or "hexadecemial"
// The code for the generateshapes.js will also handle text
// The code for generateshapes.js will have to render and combine the shapes and text into one and another
// There will need to be code to that test everything in a file called shapes.test.js that is powered by jest package
// Conditions will have to be coded to ensure that the correct shape text and placement are executed 
// The code for generateshapes.js will then create a svg file that can be displayed once it test as true in all conditions
