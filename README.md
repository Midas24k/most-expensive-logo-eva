![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Mit-yellow.svg)

## Description:

This project is a commiand-line application built with node.js that takes user inputs and generates a SVG file. The application prompts the user for the text, color, and shape of the logo using the Inquirer package. Due to the many moving pieces of this application, test were required to ensure that everything worked properly. The test were powered b using the Jest package in nodejs as well. A full tutorial will be added to the installation section as well as pictures of important pieces of the code.
